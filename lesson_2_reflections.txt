Q:	What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A:  When we initialize a repository, git creates a .git metadata file that 
	stores all of the commit history information. We need to inizialize so
	that git knows where the files will be locatied to track.

Q:	How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
	What value do you think it offers?

A:	The staging area offers a separate "temporary directory" where files are kept
	with the intention of commiting them.
	It offers more flexibility into choosing what files the user wants to commit
	when there are many other files to consider in a project.

Q:	How can you use the staging area to make sure yo have one commit per logical change?

A:	The staging area can be used to check between the working directory and the 
	commit log repository (recent commit) and search for changes done.
