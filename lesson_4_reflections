Q:  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work 
    local?

A:  Creating a remote repository allows you to share your work as an open source project
	or save it privately so that you can work on it from a different computer. It is also a way to share your changes to a team to collaborate remotely and allow changes to be made without having to work in the same place.

Q:	Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
	automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A:	Sometimes the user doesn't want changes made by other users contributing to the
	current project. Having to manually pull changes keeps your local repository from
	complications.
