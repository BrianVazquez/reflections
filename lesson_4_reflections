Q:  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A:  Creating a remote repository allows you to share your work as an open source project or
    save it privately so that you can work on it from a different computer. It is also a way
    to share your changes to a team to collaborate remotely and allow changes to be made without
    having to work in the same place.
